avalanche
=========

avalanche is a highly specialized agent for backing up photos from Adobe Lightroom to Amazon Glacier. Given a Lightroom catalog, avalanche will determine which files have been added to any collections and back those files up to Amazon Glacier.

avalanche uses a locally-stored sqlite database to keep track of which files it has sent to Glacier. Since Glacier is designed primarily for storing data, it is not feasible to directly compare local data against Glacier; thus, the local database is critical for determining which files need to be backed up to Glacier. It is recommended to store this database in an automatically backed-up location, such as a Dropbox directory.

# Parameters

## Amazon Params
*-gk		Glacier Access Key ID (always required)

*-gs		Glacier Secret Access Key (always required)

*-ga		Glacier Account Name (not required, not recommended to provide unless you know why you're doing it)

*-gsns	Amazon SNS Topic ID (only required for pulling data)

*-gv		Glacier Vault Name (always required; it will be created if not already found)

*-gr		Amazon AWS region (always required), options are {APNortheast1, APSoutheast1, APSoutheast2, CNNorth1, EUWest1, SAEast1, USEast1, USGovCloudWest1, USWest1, USWest2}

## Avalanche Params
*-lc		Ligthroom Catalog absolute path (required)

*-ad		Avalanche DB absolute path (required). You should use the same avalanche DB all the time.

*-c		Avalanche Config File absolute path

# JSON Config File

avalanche can load configuration parameters from a json file. By default, it tries to load from avalanche.json in the "My Documents" directory, but you can also specify one with the -c parameter.

## File Format
```json
{
	"Glacier":
	{	
		"AccountId":"-",
		"AccessKeyId":"AMAZON-ACCESS-KEY",
		"Region":"us-east-1",
		"SecretAccessKey":"SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
		"SnsTopicId":"arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:idnumber:email",
		"VaultName":"Lightroom-Raws"
	},	
	"Avalanche":
	{
		"CatalongFilePath":"X:\\Pictures\\Catalogs\\DesktopCatalog0-2.lrcat",
		"AvalancheFilePath":"X:\\Dropbox\\Avalanche\\avalanche.sqlite"
	},
	"ConfigFileLocation":null
}
```
 
# Backup Files
avalanche sends backup files to Glacier in a composite, compressed format. Since Glacier storage strips files of all data, including name, the files need to be self-contained. Each file is 7zipped, and contains the original image file and a text document containing a json description of the original file and its relation to its original catalog.
